# Deep Learning For Dummies

With Keras, Deep Learning has became accessible for many of programmers. However, people with non-programming background often find even Keras somewhat confusing.

Many of them are comfortable with sklearn's modeling API. In this repo, I will try to write sklearn style wrapper for Deep Learning models, such as Feedforward Neural Network, RNN's and CNN, starting from FNN. The focus is on automate the process of building computation graph, hence the user is abstracted out from the technicalities like different types of layers, activation functions, optimizers etc. It still gives user as much control as possible along with sensible defaults.

I wrote the initial class for my own use to quickly try different hyperparameters. Later some of my co-workers found it helpful. I am trying to develop it further with enhanced functionality in the hope that more people will find it helpful and time saving. Currently, it only supports Feedforward Network, but I am planning to add Recurrent Networks and Convolutional Networks soon.
