With Keras, Deep Learning has became accessible for majority of programmers. However, people with non-programming background often find even 'Keras' somewhat confusing. Many of them are comfortable with sklearn's models. Here, I will try to write sklearn style wrapper for Deep Learning models, such as Feedforward Neural Network, RNN's and CNN, starting from FNN.
